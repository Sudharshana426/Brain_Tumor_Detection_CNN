An AI-powered Brain Tumor Classification System!

ðŸ”¬ Key Features:
- Deep learning model that classifies MRI scans into 4 categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor
- Achieved 96% accuracy across all classes
- Real-time saliency map visualization showing which regions influenced the model's decision
- Built with Python, TensorFlow, and ONNX for efficient deployment

I developed a Brain Tumor Classification Model. I used Transfer Learning with the Xception model and also built a Custom CNN model using different layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Batch Normalization, achieving an impressive 97% accuracy on a Kaggle dataset.


ðŸŽ¯ Impact: This tool could assist medical professionals in preliminary screening and provide visual explanations for the model's decisions, making AI more transparent in healthcare.
